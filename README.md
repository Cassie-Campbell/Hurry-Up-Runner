# "Hurry up!" the runner game

"Hurry up!" is a small funny game made with Phaser 3. You can try it [here](https://voiceless-coder.itch.io/hurry-up)

This game is about ordinary salaryman that hurries for his job. There are several types of traps and only one control to guide the man to finish. It is just a small project for practicing, that's why there are only three levels, but they are difficult enough if you want to pass them perfectly, i.e. get three stars.
